# AIS
Airport Information System


We use this repository to build a website to sell our airport system platform.

AIS  is a software platform that digitizes and scales every single aspect of a modern day airport. Some of the modules offered by AIS are: desk check in, web check in, self check in, scheduling, flight management, cargo, balance etc.

In the framework of this project, we are creating a website that enables the purchase of AIS modules.

Our idea is to have 5 screens: home, modules, about us, blog and contact us.

The home page will contain basic information about the AIS software platform. Modules page will contain a list of modules that AIS offers. Open job positions and current employees will be displayed on about us page.
The blog page will contain interesting articles related to aviation and  contact us page will contain primary informations for contact.

The project is done for educational purposes and my colleague Marin BaraÄ‡ and I will work on it.
